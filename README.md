# The Bak3D Rendering Demo Engine
Made by George Mavroeidis

## Motivation
I always wanted to improve my fundamentals of computer graphics, so this project is a demonstration of multiple concepts regarding the graphics pipeline. Back in school, I used to study a lot of this subject, but I always felt I was leaving some important knowledge behind as time passed on. So to mitigate that, I thoroughly reviewed computer graphics the past few months.

## What is Bak3D
Bak3D is a demo rendering engine that demonstrates light and texture properties using a model made up of multiple mesh objects. The basis of these properties rely on shaders, vertex arrays and buffer objects. All the content such as models and textures are loaded up using asset importing, a technique that loads generic 3D models with textures. The user is able to also control the camera and position themselves relatively to the center of the world, which is surrounded by a grid with the model in the middle.

## How it's made
The project is made in C++ and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org), two crucial tools that are necessary to use in computer graphics. Additionally, the [Assimp library](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) is used to assist with model loading and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the user interface. As you might have noticed, all these tools are open-source and free to use. More details on the Aknowledgements section.

## Features
